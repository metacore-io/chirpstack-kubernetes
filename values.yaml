  ## The list of additional hostnames to be covered with this ingress record.
  ## Most likely the hostname above will be enough, but in the event more hosts are needed, this is an array
  ## extraHosts:
  ## - name: chirpstack.local

  ## The tls configuration for additional hostnames to be covered with this ingress record.
  ## see: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#tls
  #extraTls:
  #- hosts:
  #    - chirpstack.local
  #  secretName: chirpstack.local-tls

  ## If you're providing your own certificates, please use this to add the certificates as secrets
  ## key and certificate should start with -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- or
  ## -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
  ##
  ## name should line up with a tlsSecret set further up
  ## If you're using cert-manager, this is unneeded, as it will create the secret for you if it is not set
  ##
  ## It is also possible to create and manage the certificates outside of this helm chart
  ## Please see README.md for more information
